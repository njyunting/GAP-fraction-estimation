# 1.Run leaf segmentation program

**Note: the file loading path needs to be adjusted**    

Run main.m in a folder named  leaf_segmetation for wood/leaf segmentation.

# 2. Run hex box generation program
 
**Note: the file loading path needs to be adjusted**
The folder hex_box_generation aim to create the hex box for leaves. Please run step_1_new.m,step2_pts_findingbox.m and step3_pts_draw.m in the folder sequentially to generate leaf bounding boxes.
